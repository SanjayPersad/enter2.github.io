Tobago’s slogan “clean, green, serene” might suggest a sleepy Caribbean idyll. Given how laid back Tobago’s vibe is, you might be forgiven for thinking that the entire island shuts down after sunset. Not so. The entertainment and nightclub scene is fast expanding and growing ever-more sophisticated. Tobago is attracting international acts and patrons. In fact, there are enough nightspots – bars, restaurants, clubs, casinos and open-air party venues – to keep the most dedicated night-owl entertained. Whatever your pleasure, music or drinking, dancing or gambling, the island can offer something for everyone when the sun goes down. A night on the town in Tobago is now a serious affair. Well… almost.</p></center></td>

                                                            Many restaurants, bars and other locations, especially in the Crown Point area, offer a variety of nightly live entertainment. If there are no big festivals or events on, bars, clubs, hotels and restaurants feature local performers and music acts as regular and rotating headliners, with theme nights reserved for hip-hop, jazz, Latin, reggae, R&B, and of course calypso, soca and steelpan music.<br>

                                                            Tobago is staging big music concerts these days, often featuring Jamaican dancehall or reggae singers – more choices on the entertainment menu.</p></center></td>

It’s technically not a club, though it can function like one, if need be. It’s a sports bar, with two pool tables for those interested in the game, seating for those who like to sit and chat, and open air seating for those who like to sit and chat in the cool (weather permitting) Caribbean air. This stylish new sports bar is located right at the Scarborough port, giving you relaxing views of the ships and ferries coming and going. BarCode has a number of television screens that at any time could be running a sporting highlights or related coverage, scenes from a past BarCode event, or live footage of performances being hosted in the bar. The food is truly varied for a late night spot, and you might even be surprised at how well some of it tastes (including a local staple, fish broth). Make sure to try some of their signature drinks to wash it down. So shoot some pool; watch big sports games on their big-screen TV; or rock to the beat of their live music acts.

<br>The Shade<br>
Perhaps the undisputed champion of nightclubs in Tobago, this club in Bon Accord is the only open air one on the island. Friday and Saturday nights draw huge crowds into its open-air dance floor with carat-thatched bar and trees nestled throughout the compound. The disco lights and fog machines are especially popular with the younger crowd. DJs play soca, dancehall and hip hop, with a sprinkling of alternative, rock and reggae during the night. Relax and take in the moves from the edge, or jump in and get sweaty. The vibe tends to be warm and welcoming – the main business being dancing and having a blast. The crowd tends to be a mix of Tobagonians, Trinis and visitors.

If you find a single beach in Tobago that doesn’t tempt you to take a quick dip or a soak in the sun, please tell us about it. Even so, a few beaches really stand out. We’ve picked 10 of our favourites for their accessibility, cleanliness, facilities (like toilets and changing rooms), on-site refreshments (bars, restaurants, vendors), safety, ambience, and the quality of the swimming. So if you can’t take in every single one of the island’s fantastic beaches, here are our top picks.</p></center></td>

            <tr>
                        <td><center><p style="color: white;"><br>Crown Point<br> This is probably Tobago’s most famous beach, just a few minutes from ANR Robinson (formerly Crown Point) International Airport. There’s a little journey to get there (which is fine if you have a vehicle, or don’t mind a little walk), and an entry fee (TT$20), but you’re sure to recognise the distinctive cabana at the end of the jetty. Protected by Buccoo Reef, the calm waters make it ideal for families – but stay within the red markers while swimming. The beach scores high for accessibility, cleanliness, amenities, safety, and clear shallow water: swimming and snorkelling are a dream. The shape and scope of the beach means that even when it’s crowded, you often feel you still have some space and privacy. Food and beverage vendors are on hand; Renmar’s, the beach bar, has a surprisingly large range of drinks and cocktails. Glass-bottom boats leave from here to Buccoo Reef and the Nylon Pool, and watersports are well catered for. Watersports businesses operate from the far end. There are toilets and showers, and lifeguards on duty.

                        <br>Englishman’s Bay  
                        <br>This quiet secluded beach is one of Tobago’s best kept secrets (but not for much longer!): half a mile or so of powdery sand, hugged by lush vegetation and hidden from the main road – you could easily find yourself one of just a few people there. Its tree-framed, crescent-shaped bay exudes a beguiling tranquillity, with the crashing surf and squawking parrots often the only sounds to be heard. Deep, clear water offers good swimming and snorkelling but beware: it shelves away steeply. Craft shopping and restaurant onsite serving delicious local food.

                        <br>Castara
                        <br>Quiet and unspoilt beach in a friendly fishing village. Enjoy the sight of fishermen bringing in their nets (“pulling seine”) or bread baked in old-fashioned dirt ovens. Facilities, stores and craft stalls. Accommodation nearby.

                        <br>Pirate’s Bay
                        <br> One of Tobago’s most stunning and unspoilt bays, though it takes a little effort to get there. From Charlotteville’s eastern tip, a half-mile long, coastline-hugging dirt road brings you to a 157-step descent to the beach. No facilities.

                        <br>Mt. Irvine
                        <br>A pair of beaches offering excellent facilities and some of the island’s best snorkelling. The Mt. Irvine Beach Hotel side, open to the public, offers refreshments and all beach amenities. Mt. Irvine Bay, a short walk away, is a popular watersports and snorkelling spot: coral, sponge and reef fish species abound here. Snorkelling gear, canoes and hobie cats can be hired onsite.

                        <br>Speyside & Blue Waters
                        <br> Unlike other Windward Coast beaches, Speyside and Blue Waters are protected by nearby coral reef systems and islands. Both offer tranquillity, great snorkelling and the chance to join a glass-bottom boat tour to Angel Reef, Goat Island and Little Tobago.

                        <br>Store Bay
                        <br>Tobago’s second most popular beach, after Pigeon Point, near hotels and the airport. Fine golden sand descends into crystal clear water. Many glass-bottom boat operators begin Buccoo Reef trips here. The water is good for swimming, and there are lifeguards, showers and toilets (small fee), food and beverage vendors. The beach experience here ranks high for accessibility, cleanliness, amenities, safety, and idyllic water. The beach is usually busy, and the one disadvantage could be the number of vendors (for beach chairs, reef tours, jewellery, etc.). But their zeal can generally be neutralised by a friendly “no thanks”. Buccoo Reef and Nylon Pool glass-bottom boat tours leave from here through the early afternoon. There’s also excellent craft shopping.<br>
                        <br>Canoe Bay
                        <br> This is a private beach with an entrance fee. Tobago’s calmest and shallowest bathing beach, perfect for young families. Rarely crowded, with excellent facilities including bar and beachfront cabanas. Beware mosquitoes at sunset and rugged approach road. It is one of the calmest beaches in Tobago, perfect for children since there are practically no concerns about aggressive tides or currents. Changing facilities are available, and a bar which also provides food.
                        <br>
                        <br>Bloody Bay:
                        <br> Don’t let the name fool you: this is one of the most unspoilt and peaceful beaches in Tobago. The golden sand, clear blue water and the odd fisherman may be your only company. This quiet beach scores for its great swimming and cleanliness, with recently installed amenities and facilities, including changing rooms, toilets and showers, a small bar, parking, and lifeguards.

                        <br>Back Bay
                        <br> This is a beautiful and often deserted beach. There’s even a little pool that nature seemed to make just for two, where water flows in and out with the tide. It has great natural beauty and placidity, but because of the isolation, with no amenities or lifeguards, we strongly advise you to go with a group.</br>
