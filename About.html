The islands offer endless possibilities for a local day trip, weekend getaway, leisurely beach vacation, or exhilerating eco adventure holiday. This island pride is well earned.Tobago is one of the few remaining Caribbean oases not overrun by tourism, with idyllic beaches, unspoilt rainforest, and folk traditions that have stood the test of time.<br> Tobago is the place for an idyllic beach getaway, an escape into nature, a heart-pounding eco-adventure on land or at sea (and now, for investment). Trinidad, meanwhile, moves at a frenetic pace, from the driving rhythms of Carnival to a robust economy open for international business. Trinidad is the economic powerhouse with its oil and gas, its unique culture spawning dynamic creative industries and world-renowned festivals.In these two islands, distinct as they are, you will find a spectacular natural environment, a creative and self-reliant people, brimming with humour, candour and a spirit of festivity, and a country not overrun by tourism.<br> In both islands, you will find an honesty, playfulness, warmth and independence that define the spirit of a nation and an awe-inspiring natural environment. These are our communities, our cities, our people, and our islands, and it is to these that Discover Trinidad & Tobago hopes to introduce you. Here’s some more to introduce you to the islands.

Trinidad is bigger, about 65 miles by 50, though long peninsulas on its western coast add to its breadth. There’s a beautiful mountain range along the northern coast, and lower ranges of hills in the centre and south of the island, with flat or rolling plains between.

In Trinidad, the population is very mixed, descended mainly from Africa and India – each just under 40% of the population – but also from Europe, the Mediterranean and the Middle East, even China, and a few from the original Amerindian settlers. There are some wonderful ethnic mixtures; over 20% of the population identifies as being of mixed ethnicity.

This, for the most part, is a place of stimulus and excitement rather than relaxation. It demands participation: in a sport, a festival, a journey of discovery. A place that gives back what is put into it.<br>The flip side is Tobago, serene, philosophical, dreaming beneath the sun and the wash of the waves. Tobago, where the sea’s blue is startling and the roads wind like snakes along the steep green hillsides, is the place for dozing in a hammock, snorkelling on a reef, sipping a rum punch at sunset. A place for rest, or romance; for regeneration.<br>Toss a coin, take your pick; choose one island or both. Heads or tails — you win. Expect an unforgettable experience.

                        The Trini dialect is as colourful and inventive as the people who use it. Some of the expressions below are quite old, possibly brought from homelands across the seas, passed on and now adopted by all. Others are more recent slang that you may hear on the streets by the younger generation.<br>

                        But if you’re new to Trinidad Carnival, know that most everything else you’ve heard about it is true. Yes, people dance and party in the streets for two days straight. People let loose for weeks before the dancing and partying in the streets on Carnival Monday and Tuesday. Yes, it’s the mother of West Indian-style carnivals throughout the Americas. You can get a taste of the experience in New York, Toronto, London and other Caribbean strongholds the world over, but you won’t know true Trini Carnival experience until you return to the source. And yes, love it or hate it, it is a uniquely Trinidadian experience you are unlikely to forget.</p></center></td>

It used to be from Boxing Day (the day after Christmas) that radio stations across the islands would switch from Christmas music (or whatever they were playing) to Carnival music. But these days, with Carnival band launchings starting as early as July, and soca artists unveiling their big Carnival tunes months before at carnivals in the diaspora, it seems that Carnival is ever-present. It’s no wonder, then, Trinidadians are accused of having a “Carnival mentality”.<br>

                        Nevertheless, it’s after Christmas that Carnival fêtes featuring the biggest soca stars begin in earnest. The radio and television airwaves are dominated by the latest soca, calypso and pan tunes, while would-be masqueraders embark on gruelling fitness regimens to build up their stamina and physiques for the wining season.<br>

                        This is also when the competitions begin for steelbands, calypsonians, soca singers, limbo dancers, stickfighters, costume designers, traditional Carnival characters, and Carnival Kings and Queens. These showcase the best practitioners of our Carnival arts.<br>

                        <br>Warming Up: the Week Before<br>
                        The excitement builds the week before Carnival, with wall-to-wall fêtes, events and competitions. Early on “Fantastic Friday” morning, stickfighters, moko jumbies and a cast of actors and dancers descend on east Port of Spain to re-enact the Canboulay Riots. In the early afternoon, traditional Carnival characters take the spotlight in Port of Spain. And as 9pm hits, some of the biggest soca stars begin to vie for the Soca Monarch crowns.<br>

                        The streets belong to the children on Carnival Saturday for Kiddies Carnival at the Savannah; some of the finest costume designs are seen right there. Once night falls, steelbands clash at Panorama, the greatest showcase for the instrument anywhere in the world.<br>
                        <br>
                        Sunday – Dimanche Gras – is reserved for two of the hallmarks of Carnival: the breathtaking costumes of would-be Kings and Queens of Carnival, and the race for the Calypso Monarch crown.<br>

                        <br>The Climax: Carnival Monday & Tuesday<br>
                        From 4am Monday morning, scores of people chip and slither through the streets of the country’s cities, covered in paint, grease and mud. This is J’ouvert, with traditional Carnival characters like jab jabs, blue devils, and bats, alongside those in outrageous costumes – or just old clothes. Once the sun comes up, most stagger into bed to sleep off the high (natural or induced). This is J’ouvert:

                        Around 11am the action picks up again as thousands flock into Port of Spain to meet their band (or the one they intend to crash). Almost no one is in full costume, though – the joy is in just being in the streets, with music and merriment continuing well after dark.

                        Tuesday starts early, and bands typically dance along specific routes between judging posts, where adjudicators choose the next Band of the Year.

                        Some with less energy crash at sundown, but others keep following the huge music trucks until Last Lap. It is only then, or perhaps on the beach the next day (a post-Carnival tradition), that you can finally permit sleep to come.</p></center></td>
